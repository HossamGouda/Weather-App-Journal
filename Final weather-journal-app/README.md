# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.


Steps: 
1-created local server with express package 
2-installed and required the requested packages as (express, cors,body-parser)
3-I replaced body-parser with express since it is became intgrated with express.
4-created server and runing it in port locally then creating the routs (get,post)
5-added a meta tag in th html file to make it responsive.
